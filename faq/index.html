<h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2>

<section class="faq">
<h3 id="builtin-exploits">Does Ronin have builtin exploits?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Ronin does not ship with any builtin Exploits. Although, Ronin
  makes it rather easy to write your own exploits using
  <a href="https://github.com/gems/ronin-exploits">ronin-exploits</a>
  library and distribute them in <a href="#repos">Repositories</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  It takes a lot of time and energy to write and weaponize exploits
  for known vulnerabilities; let alone find new vulnerabilities.
  So, we decided to leave the exploit writing up to the skilled
  security researchers of the world, and let them decide how and when
  to distribute their own exploits.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="autopwn">Does Ronin provide an autopwn-like feature?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Ronin does not provide an <i>autopwn-like</i> feature.
    Features such as <code>autopwn</code> make assumptions about the
    workflow of a "real attacker", and attempt to automate it.
    Naturally, the "real attackers" will change their tactics and use
    new types of information gathering (ex: Datamining Social Networks)
    and attacks (ex: Phishing) which may not cleanly fit into existing
    Exploitation Frameworks; thus rendering <i>autopwn-like</i> features
    outdated and ineffective.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ronin was designed to not impose a workflow onto the user.
    Instead, Ronin provides useful APIs, commands and a Database
    for the user to leverage however they want to.
  </p>
</div>
</section>

<h2 id="repos">Repositories</h2>

<section class="faq">
<h3 id="ronin-repo">What is a Ronin Repository?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Ronin Repositories are very similar to RubyGems. They both can contain
  Ruby code in a <code>lib/</code> directory, command-line scripts in a
  <code>bin/</code> and data files in a <code>data/</code> directory.
  Ronin Repositories also have a <code>ronin.yml</code> metadata file and a
  <code>cache/</code> directory for exploits, payloads, scanners or anything
  else Ronin can cache into it's Database.
  </p>

  <p>
  Think of Ronin Repositoires as a quicker / less-formal way to organize your
  code.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="ronin-repo-hosting">How are 3rd party repositories hosted?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  3rd party repositories use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and anyone
  can host their own 3rd party repository on any popular Git hosting services,
  such as
  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="install-ronin-repo">How can I install a 3rd party repository with Ronin?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Simply pass the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> URL to the
  <kbd>ronin-repos install</kbd> command:
  </p>

  {% highlight shell %}ronin-repos install https://github.com/user/repo.git{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<h3 id="generate-ronin-repo">How can I generate my own 3rd party repository?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  You can generate your own new 3rd party repository using the
  <kbd>ronin-repos new</kbd> command:
  </p>

  {% highlight shell %}ronin-repos new path/to/repo{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
  Then simply publish the git repository to
  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>.
  </p>
</div>
</section>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<section class="faq">
<h3 id="readable-code">How readable is Ronin's code-base?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Other projects have been criticized for having poor
  programming conventions or a lack of documentation. To
  avoid this, Ronin follows the Ruby community's
  <a href="https://github.com/styleguide/ruby">style guidelines</a> to
  ensure that all source-code is clean, readable and maintainable.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="github">Where is Ronin's code-base hosted?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Ronin and it's many libraries are hosted on
  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="test-suite">Does Ronin have a test-suite so that I can ensure that Ronin is bug free?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Yes, Ronin comes with extensive <a href="https://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>
  specification tests.
  </p>

  <p>
  One can run the specification suite in any of Ronin's libraries, by running
  the following command:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$ rake spec</code</pre>
