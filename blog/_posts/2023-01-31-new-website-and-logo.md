The [website](https://ronin-rb.dev/) has been redesigned!

If you notice any CSS issues on your browser or device, *please* report them to
the [website's issue tracker][issues].

## New Logo!

You will also notice the brand new redesigned [logo]. Note that the new logo is 
licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International][CC-BY-ND],
meaning you can copy the logo, but not modify it, and you must link back to
[https://ronin-rb.dev](https://ronin-rb.dev).

## Accessibility

While we have made an effort to make the website accessible, it can probably be
made even *more* accessible. If you have any suggestions on how
to improve the website's accessibility, please add comments to
[this issue][accessibility-issue].

## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to the website, checkout the [source].
Note, that the website uses [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Bulma CSS][bulma], and
explicitly does not use any fancy JavaScript or CSS frameworks, such as React or
Tailwind, in order to keep things as simple as possible.

We also have plans for adding a [dark-mode][dark-mode-issue] which we could use 
help with.
