title: New Year, new domain

We have made it to 2021. To celebrate the new year and new possibilities,
I've decided to "rebrand" Ronin and rename it's domain, GitHub Org, official
Twitter handle, IRC channel, etc.

* Domain: [ronin-rb.dev](https://ronin-rb.dev)
* GitHub Org: [ronin-rb](https://github.com/ronin-rb)
* Twitter: [@ronin_rb](https://twitter.com/ronin_rb)
* IRC: [#ronin-rb irc.freenode.net](/irc/)

Not only is this easier to type than "ronin_ruby", it helps differentiate the
project from other projects that also use the Ronin name.
